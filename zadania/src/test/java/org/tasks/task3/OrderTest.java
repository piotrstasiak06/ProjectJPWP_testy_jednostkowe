// INTRODUCTION
// In JUnit 5, the @BeforeEach and @AfterEach annotations are used to signal that the annotated method should be executed before or after each test method in the class.

// @Before each annotation is used to execute a method before each test method in a class.
// @AfterEach annotation is used to execute a method after each test method in a class.

// You can check the documentation for more information about the usage of these decorators.

// Your task is to refactor the code below by using @BeforeEach and @AfterEach decorator to get all tests green.

// The Order class represents an order containing a list of Meal objects.
// Consider how the code is working. Can we refactor it to eliminate redundant code?

// If you don't have any ideas, look at line 150 to see the "TIP_1" comment.

// Does the code work now as intended? Do all tests pass? If not, try to find the issue. Consider if we
// have our "workspace" cleaned after initializing an object before each test method. Note that each test should be independent of others.
// It is unacceptable to have a situation where one test affects the result of another test.

// If you still don't know what the author had in mind, check line 210 to see the "TIP_2" comment.

// method with @BeforeEach decorator.
//
// This will work as a setup, which is executed before each test method - so we will always have initialized
// an object before running each test.
//
// However, some test still fails - it is caused by a static field which is not cleaned after use.
// Other tests may be affected by this, and therefore it is possible that they will show incorrect results.
